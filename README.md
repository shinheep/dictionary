## Project Description

I built this project on a whim one afternoon because I wanted to have a dictionary on hand that didn't look cluttered. Often, if you look at public Dictionary websites, there are ads, or other things that seem to distract the user. I built this simple Dictionary for my personal use, and also for my friends who encountered the same issues.

This Dictionary was built using the [Free Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/)
